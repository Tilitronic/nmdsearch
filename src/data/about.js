The MDSearch page was created primarily to search for the meaning of 
an English word in several sources at once. When I watched cartoons or 
read books in English and looked for definitions of unfamiliar words, 
I often found myself having to look up the word in several places because 
the first place provided unclear definition, definition that don't fit or 
no definition at all. It annoyed me!
